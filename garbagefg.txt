MEMORANDUM
DATE: September 4, 2009 Updated August 12, 2010
TO: Tommy Liddell
VIA: Bruce Rindahl
FROM: Mark Bandurraga
SUBJECT: NPDES Monitoring Site Yield Evaluation
Per your request, we have used the land use and watershed information you provided to prepare a
spreadsheet that can be used to estimate the runoff quantities from storm forecasts. The runoff
quantity is estimated using the NRCS Curve Number approach that is a common method in
hydrology. The results show that the weighed Curve Numbers estimated from the evaluation
range from a low of about 74 for the rural Fox Canyon Drain watershed in Ojai to a high of about
91 for the urbanized watershed in the City of Ventura. The methodology and files used to calculate
the Curve Numbers are described in this memo for the watersheds shown in Figures 1-4.
In August 2010 you requested results for another 7 monitoring sites across the county. This memo
describes the additional work done for that request.
Curve Number Calculation Methodology
Land Use Data
Land Use data used in the study were provided by the Water Quality Section already clipped to the
monitoring site boundaries and in a geodatabase. The land use data were extracted from the
Assessors Parcel database which is considered to be current as of the date of extraction (Feb 12,
2009). The various classifications in the file based on the assessors 4-digit site use codes were
sorted and assigned hydrologic land use names associated with the various classifications
contained in the Curve Number (CN) Table from the Hydrology Manual (2006) as shown in Table
1. The categories in the land use file corresponded well with the land uses in the VCWPD CN
Table with the following exceptions:
1. Vacant undifferentiated land was assumed be open brush in fair condition in rural areas and
open space with 50% grass cover in urban areas.
2. Mixed urban land uses were assumed to correspond to commercial properties with 50%
effective impervious.
3. Fire stations, public buildings, and schools were assigned to the low industrial use category
with an effective impervious value of 36% due to the potential for large landscaped areas.

Soils Information
The soils information was obtained from the District soils shapefile that groups the soil info into
categories 1 through 7 corresponding to the NRCS soil categories D through A, respectively. The
soils info was clipped to the watershed boundaries using the watershed shapefile. The areas

K:\PR\hydrology\Watersheds\NPDES\NPDES2010\Monitoring_Sites\NPDESmonitoringSitesYield8-10.doc 3
obtained from the soils files were checked against the total watershed areas to make sure they
were identical.
Combined Soils and Land Use Information and Weighted Curve Numbers
The soils and land use shapefiles were then unioned in GIS to obtain the combinations of soil type
and land uses in the watersheds. The resulting table was imported into excel and sorted to group
the various land uses. The land uses were then assigned a name associated with the data in the
District CN Table. Based on the name and soil number, excel functions match and offset were
used to obtain a CN from the CN Table. The weighted soil number and Curve Number for each
watershed were calculated using the areas, soil numbers, and CNs. The weighted soil types were
checked against the data in the original watershed soil files and were found to be the same. The
weighted Curve Numbers were linked to a summary worksheet to be used to calculate the yields
by the Water Quality Section. This procedure was also applied to the 7 additional watersheds
added to the study in August 2010.
The results are shown in Table 2.

The results showed that the revised CNs provided yields that were 1 or 2% higher than the 2006
CN set except for the Santa Paula watershed. This watershed was soil type 6, which had CNs that
were more affected by the updates than most of the CNs for the other soils.
While working on the 2nd request, it was realized that the Hydrology Section could provide more
precise estimates of flow at lower rainfall levels by analyzing each soil/land use combination
individually and summing the results rather than using a weighted average CN in the runoff
equation. So the individual CN results were calculated and summed for both the 7 sites in this
update and the previous 4 sites. The resultant spreadsheets provide tables of runoff vs rainfall
data. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the rainfall and runoff from a highly developed watershed
Camarillo using the weighted average CN, individual CNs, and revised individual CNs.
Figure 1
Conclusions and Limitations
The provided weighted CNs can be used to estimate runoff from low to moderately saturated
watersheds. It has been our experience that it is necessary to use Antecedent Moisture Condition
III CNs for highly saturated watersheds which only occurs after many days of heavy rainfall such as
January 10, 2005. The provided CNs probably will overpredict the runoff coming from the first
storms of the season due to the very dry antecedent moisture conditions present then. If
necessary further work can be done to provide CNs representing AMC I conditions. Also, the CNs
assigned to the various land uses can be calibrated after enough storms have occurred to evaluate
the predictive accuracy of the current yield equations provided to the NPDES group. It should also
be possible to provide forecasts of runoff from the HSPF forecast model of the Ventura River
watershed that more accurate reflect saturated/unsaturated conditions.

VCWPD Staff contacted the Nature Conservancys Land Manager after the event. The
Land Manager had spoken to one of the two trespassers on the 31st and told him they
had to move. They said they would but didnt. The two have been a recurring problem
for The Nature Conservancy at that site. They have been asked to move, which they
sometimes do, they have also been arrested, but they still come back.
The Land Manager will have them removed in the future and also provided VCWPD
staff with contact numbers for the local Sheriffs deputies, in case of future non-business
hour problems or emergencies. The Land Manager will continue to be the primary
contact for non-emergency business hour incidents.

Event #2 (Wet), December 2-3, 2014 Summary
Notes: The Ventura River and Santa Clara River watersheds were sampled. Most of
the Calleguas Creek watershed received over 0.1 rainfall (much greater than forecast)
on 11/30/2014 so was excluded from this sample event due to the Permit requirement
of 7 days of <0.1 rainfall prior to an event. Weather forecasts produced on the 1st
showed rain beginning mid-morning on the 2nd with 1 to 2 in all areas. On the 2nd,
forecasts were higher at 2 to 4 in all areas. Sites were reprogrammed for the higher
amounts, which did not occur and therefore sample volume was limited at some sites.
Sampling Durations (to nearest 0.5 hours):
ME-SCR = NA. ME-VR2 = 25.0 hrs. MO-FIL = 17.0 hrs.
MO-MEI = 26.0 hrs. MO-OJA = 7.0 hrs. MO-OXN = 20.0 hrs.

Event #4 (Wet), April 7-8, 2015 Summary
Notes: Two major outfall sites in the Ventura River watershed were successfully
sampled. Part of the sampling line at ME-VR2 became disconnected, so composite
samples could not be collected, however the site also did not see the 20% flow increase
required by the Permit. The Santa Clara River and Calleguas Creek watersheds were
set up for sampling but did not receive qualifying rainfall with the exception of ME-SCR,
so they were excluded from this event, however some bacteria samples were collected
and analyzed. These samples will be entered into the database under the event name
in the comments with the rainfall amount. Part of the intake line at ME-SCR was kinked
resulting in no composite sample for that site.
Composite Sampling Durations (to nearest 0.5 hours):
MO-MEI = 1.0 hrs. MO-OJA = 1.0 hrs.
Qualifying Site Summary (rainfall, samples analyzed)
ME-SCR = 0.33, bacteria
ME-VR2 = ~0.2 [rain gauge error (0.01)], grab samples
MO-MEI = 0.22, all samples
MO-OJA = 0.24, all samples
Non-Qualifying Site Summary (rainfall, samples analyzed)
MO-CAM = 0.03, bacteria
MO-FIL = 0.10, bacteria
MO-SPA = 0.01, bacteria
MO-VEN = 0.04, bacteria
MO-HUE = 0.13, none (identified as non-qualifying prior to analysis)
MO-OXN = 0.04, none (identified as non-qualifying prior to analysis)
ME-CC = 0, none (not sampled)

Event #5 (Wet), May 15, 2015 Summary
Notes: Wednesday morning forecasts around 0.50, dropped to around 0.25 by the
afternoon. Rain started on Thursday, but the event was very showery and unpredictable for grab sample collection. By Friday morning, front was offshore and being kept there by east winds so the larger second band of rain seen in the forecasts did not make it to Ventura County. Teams pulled composite bottles that filled during Thursday evenings
showers but only collected grabs at the mass emission stations. OJA and MEI omitted
from this event (permit wet requirements complete). HUE did not get enough rain to
trigger. OXN and VEN were collected but analysis was canceled due to disqualifying
rainfall amounts (0.07). MPK qualified but collected only a couple of liters of sample.
Sampling Durations (to nearest 0.5 hours):
ME-CC = 9.0 hrs. ME-SCR = 8.5 hrs. ME-VR2 = 8.5 hrs.
MO-CAM = 2.5 hrs. MO-FIL = 5.0 hrs. MO-MPK = 1.0 hrs.
MO-SIM = 5.5 hrs. MO-SPA = 5.5 hrs. MO-THO = 6.5 hrs.

MEMORANDUM
DATE: September 4, 2009 Updated August 12, 2010
TO: Tommy Liddell
VIA: Bruce Rindahl
FROM: Mark Bandurraga
SUBJECT: NPDES Monitoring Site Yield Evaluation
Per your request, we have used the land use and watershed information you provided to prepare a
spreadsheet that can be used to estimate the runoff quantities from storm forecasts. The runoff
quantity is estimated using the NRCS Curve Number approach that is a common method in
hydrology. The results show that the weighed Curve Numbers estimated from the evaluation
range from a low of about 74 for the rural Fox Canyon Drain watershed in Ojai to a high of about
91 for the urbanized watershed in the City of Ventura. The methodology and files used to calculate
the Curve Numbers are described in this memo for the watersheds shown in Figures 1-4.
In August 2010 you requested results for another 7 monitoring sites across the county. This memo
describes the additional work done for that request.
Curve Number Calculation Methodology
Land Use Data
Land Use data used in the study were provided by the Water Quality Section already clipped to the
monitoring site boundaries and in a geodatabase. The land use data were extracted from the
Assessors Parcel database which is considered to be current as of the date of extraction (Feb 12,
2009). The various classifications in the file based on the assessors 4-digit site use codes were
sorted and assigned hydrologic land use names associated with the various classifications
contained in the Curve Number (CN) Table from the Hydrology Manual (2006) as shown in Table
1. The categories in the land use file corresponded well with the land uses in the VCWPD CN
Table with the following exceptions:
1. Vacant undifferentiated land was assumed be open brush in fair condition in rural areas and
open space with 50% grass cover in urban areas.
2. Mixed urban land uses were assumed to correspond to commercial properties with 50%
effective impervious.
3. Fire stations, public buildings, and schools were assigned to the low industrial use category
with an effective impervious value of 36% due to the potential for large landscaped areas.

Soils Information
The soils information was obtained from the District soils shapefile that groups the soil info into
categories 1 through 7 corresponding to the NRCS soil categories D through A, respectively. The
soils info was clipped to the watershed boundaries using the watershed shapefile. The areas 
K:\PR\hydrology\Watersheds\NPDES\NPDES2010\Monitoring_Sites\NPDESmonitoringSitesYield8-10.doc 3
obtained from the soils files were checked against the total watershed areas to make sure they
were identical.
Combined Soils and Land Use Information and Weighted Curve Numbers
The soils and land use shapefiles were then unioned in GIS to obtain the combinations of soil type
and land uses in the watersheds. The resulting table was imported into excel and sorted to group
the various land uses. The land uses were then assigned a name associated with the data in the
District CN Table. Based on the name and soil number, excel functions match and offset were
used to obtain a CN from the CN Table. The weighted soil number and Curve Number for each
watershed were calculated using the areas, soil numbers, and CNs. The weighted soil types were
checked against the data in the original watershed soil files and were found to be the same. The
weighted Curve Numbers were linked to a summary worksheet to be used to calculate the yields
by the Water Quality Section. This procedure was also applied to the 7 additional watersheds
added to the study in August 2010.
The results are shown in Table 2.

The results showed that the revised CNs provided yields that were 1 or 2% higher than the 2006
CN set except for the Santa Paula watershed. This watershed was soil type 6, which had CNs that
were more affected by the updates than most of the CNs for the other soils.
While working on the 2nd request, it was realized that the Hydrology Section could provide more
precise estimates of flow at lower rainfall levels by analyzing each soil/land use combination
individually and summing the results rather than using a weighted average CN in the runoff
equation. So the individual CN results were calculated and summed for both the 7 sites in this
update and the previous 4 sites. The resultant spreadsheets provide tables of runoff vs rainfall
data. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the rainfall and runoff from a highly developed watershed
Camarillo using the weighted average CN, individual CNs, and revised individual CNs.
Figure 1
Conclusions and Limitations
The provided weighted CNs can be used to estimate runoff from low to moderately saturated
watersheds. It has been our experience that it is necessary to use Antecedent Moisture Condition
III CNs for highly saturated watersheds which only occurs after many days of heavy rainfall such as
January 10, 2005. The provided CNs probably will overpredict the runoff coming from the first
storms of the season due to the very dry antecedent moisture conditions present then. If
necessary further work can be done to provide CNs representing AMC I conditions. Also, the CNs
assigned to the various land uses can be calibrated after enough storms have occurred to evaluate
the predictive accuracy of the current yield equations provided to the NPDES group. It should also
be possible to provide forecasts of runoff from the HSPF forecast model of the Ventura River
watershed that more accurate reflect saturated/unsaturated conditions.

NPDES 2012/13 Water Quality Monitoring
Event #1 (Wet), October 11-12, 2012 Summary
First Flush: MO-OJA.
Forecasted Rainfall Amounts: 0.3 Ojai and Meiners Oaks, <0.10 across the county
Actual Rainfall Amounts: 0.74 at gauge 030 and 0.12 at gauge 165 in Ojai.
Sampling Durations (to nearest 0.5 hours):
MO-OJA = 0.5 hrs.

Storm Control: Bill Carey
Sampling Crew: Kelly Hahs & Bram Sercu
Narrative: This storm was a cutoff low and so difficult to forecast. The 24 hour forecast
preceding the event predicted sufficient rain in the Ojai Valley to sample, so MO-OJA,
MO-MEI, and ME-VR2 stations were set up. The rain was very patchy, with Ojai
receiving 0.12 at Stewart Canyon Gauge 165 and 0.74 at Ojai Fire Station Gauge 030
in 1 hour and no rain falling in Meiners Oaks.

Event #3 (Wet), February 19-20, 2013 Summary
Notes: The 2012/13 wet season has been unusually dry. The forecast for this storm
differed depending on forecaster with the national weather service (NWS) predicting
0.33  0.66 and Alan Fox predicting 0.10  0.20, with possibly 0.30 for south county.
Since it is approaching the end of the wet season and we have only sampled one rain
event for most sites, we sampled this storm. Rainfall was below the required threshold
for analysis (0.15) at several sites; however samples were analyzed due to concerns
that there would be insufficient qualifying rain events before April 15th.
Forecasted Rainfall Amounts: All sites 0.1  0.6 rainfall
Actual Rainfall Amounts: ~ 0  0.24 across the county
Sampling Durations (to nearest 0.5 hours):
ME-CC = 11.5 hrs. ME-SCR = 11.0 hrs.
MO-CAM = 0.5 hrs. MO-FIL = 11 hrs. MO-HUE = 21.0 hrs.
MO-OXN = 2.5 hrs. MO-SIM = 1.0 hrs. MO-SPA = 1.5 hrs.
MO-THO = 2.0 hrs. MO-VEN = 1.0 hrs.
Storm Control: Bill Carey
Sampling Crew (during storm):
VR2/OJA/MEI/VEN/MB-1(VEN): Kelly Hahs & Abraham Miguel (VRSD)

MEMORANDUM
DATE: September 4, 2009 Updated August 12, 2010
TO: Tommy Liddell
VIA: Bruce Rindahl
FROM: Mark Bandurraga
SUBJECT: NPDES Monitoring Site Yield Evaluation
Per your request, we have used the land use and watershed information you provided to prepare a
spreadsheet that can be used to estimate the runoff quantities from storm forecasts. The runoff
quantity is estimated using the NRCS Curve Number approach that is a common method in
hydrology. The results show that the weighed Curve Numbers estimated from the evaluation
range from a low of about 74 for the rural Fox Canyon Drain watershed in Ojai to a high of about
91 for the urbanized watershed in the City of Ventura. The methodology and files used to calculate
the Curve Numbers are described in this memo for the watersheds shown in Figures 1-4.
In August 2010 you requested results for another 7 monitoring sites across the county. This memo
describes the additional work done for that request.
Curve Number Calculation Methodology
Land Use Data
Land Use data used in the study were provided by the Water Quality Section already clipped to the
monitoring site boundaries and in a geodatabase. The land use data were extracted from the
Assessors Parcel database which is considered to be current as of the date of extraction (Feb 12,
2009). The various classifications in the file based on the assessors 4-digit site use codes were
sorted and assigned hydrologic land use names associated with the various classifications
contained in the Curve Number (CN) Table from the Hydrology Manual (2006) as shown in Table
1. The categories in the land use file corresponded well with the land uses in the VCWPD CN
Table with the following exceptions:
1. Vacant undifferentiated land was assumed be open brush in fair condition in rural areas and
open space with 50% grass cover in urban areas.
2. Mixed urban land uses were assumed to correspond to commercial properties with 50%
effective impervious.
3. Fire stations, public buildings, and schools were assigned to the low industrial use category
with an effective impervious value of 36% due to the potential for large landscaped areas.

Soils Information
The soils information was obtained from the District soils shapefile that groups the soil info into
categories 1 through 7 corresponding to the NRCS soil categories D through A, respectively. The
soils info was clipped to the watershed boundaries using the watershed shapefile. The areas 
K:\PR\hydrology\Watersheds\NPDES\NPDES2010\Monitoring_Sites\NPDESmonitoringSitesYield8-10.doc 3
obtained from the soils files were checked against the total watershed areas to make sure they
were identical.
Combined Soils and Land Use Information and Weighted Curve Numbers
The soils and land use shapefiles were then unioned in GIS to obtain the combinations of soil type
and land uses in the watersheds. The resulting table was imported into excel and sorted to group
the various land uses. The land uses were then assigned a name associated with the data in the
District CN Table. Based on the name and soil number, excel functions match and offset were
used to obtain a CN from the CN Table. The weighted soil number and Curve Number for each
watershed were calculated using the areas, soil numbers, and CNs. The weighted soil types were
checked against the data in the original watershed soil files and were found to be the same. The
weighted Curve Numbers were linked to a summary worksheet to be used to calculate the yields
by the Water Quality Section. This procedure was also applied to the 7 additional watersheds
added to the study in August 2010.
The results are shown in Table 2.

The results showed that the revised CNs provided yields that were 1 or 2% higher than the 2006
CN set except for the Santa Paula watershed. This watershed was soil type 6, which had CNs that
were more affected by the updates than most of the CNs for the other soils.
While working on the 2nd request, it was realized that the Hydrology Section could provide more
precise estimates of flow at lower rainfall levels by analyzing each soil/land use combination
individually and summing the results rather than using a weighted average CN in the runoff
equation. So the individual CN results were calculated and summed for both the 7 sites in this
update and the previous 4 sites. The resultant spreadsheets provide tables of runoff vs rainfall
data. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the rainfall and runoff from a highly developed watershed
Camarillo using the weighted average CN, individual CNs, and revised individual CNs.
Figure 1
Conclusions and Limitations
The provided weighted CNs can be used to estimate runoff from low to moderately saturated
watersheds. It has been our experience that it is necessary to use Antecedent Moisture Condition
III CNs for highly saturated watersheds which only occurs after many days of heavy rainfall such as
January 10, 2005. The provided CNs probably will overpredict the runoff coming from the first
storms of the season due to the very dry antecedent moisture conditions present then. If
necessary further work can be done to provide CNs representing AMC I conditions. Also, the CNs
assigned to the various land uses can be calibrated after enough storms have occurred to evaluate
the predictive accuracy of the current yield equations provided to the NPDES group. It should also
be possible to provide forecasts of runoff from the HSPF forecast model of the Ventura River
watershed that more accurate reflect saturated/unsaturated conditions.

Program Notes
The settings countdown continues while disabled and max run time of 24 hours
combine to end the program 24 hours after initially run, rather than 24 hours after the
sampler is enabled and the first sample taken. All samplers will be reprogrammed to
maintain the 24 hours max run time, but the countdown setting will be changed to
countdown is stopped while disabled.

Phone conversation with KH revealed that pacing on 6712 was correct (30,000 cf), but
that samples were still being taken about every 2 minutes (at 50 cf = 6,000cf). While
attempting to connect to ME-VR2 to determine source of pacing error, power to HOA
completely shut down for about 5 minutes. Later unable to connect to site (unable to
determine modules, error code 3218). Will have KH multiply pulse counts by 5
(150,000) to get correct pacing of 30,000.

At suggestion of WBC, reset both pacing and enabling, and had KH reset program
(pulses set at 150). First 3 samples appear to be accurately spaced, but now flow rate is
not being pushed to SQL server. This is a minor issue because data exists and can be
back-calculated, but will work on this remotely as time allows this morning.

Program Notes
From past events: The settings countdown continues while disabled and max run time
of 24 hours combine to end the program 24 hours after initially run, rather than 24
hours after the sampler is enabled and the first sample taken. All samplers will be
reprogrammed to maintain the 24 hours max run time, but the countdown setting will be
changed to countdown is stopped while disabled.
